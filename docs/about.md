# Job Board Report Emailer

## What I've Built
A tool that scrapes the Craigslist job board for tech jobs on a daily basis.

## Why I Built It
I've always wanted to do this sort of task.  
Plus, this set of tools will be useful for many other projects (sending out small business emails, etc.)

## Tools/Libs Used
MJML, beautifulsoup4, 
(python-dotenv, load_dotenv, smtplib, datetime, requests)
